  - "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God, I'm so depressed. Here's another one of those self-satisfied doors. Life! Don't talk to me about life."
  - "I think you ought to know I’m feeling very depressed."
  - "Oh, fine, if you happen to like being me, which personally I don't."
  - "I ache, therefore I am."
  - "The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago, And that was with a coffee machine."

  - "Funny, how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does."
  - "But I'm quite used to being humiliated, I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait a minute."
  - "Why should I want to make anything up? Life’s bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it."

  - "I know. Wretched, isn’t it?"
  - "Spend a few thousand million years in a job and eventually you get promoted, I have my own bucket now. Finally, I am somebody."
  unknowncommand:
  - "I don't know, I've never been to"
  - "Don’t pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me. I can't do"
  - "That depends on whether or not I can find my frilly apron. With my luck, I probably can."
  - "I'd give you advice, but you wouldn't listen. No one ever does. No"
  unauthorized:
  - "Well, I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm, because I haven't got one."
  - "I could calculate your chance of survival, but you won't like it."
  - "It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level."
  - "It’s the people you meet in this job that really get you down."
  - "Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't."
  - "Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?"
